workflow using Microsoft Power Automate that involves a "do until" loop for finance revision after approval from a supervisor. Here's how you can set up this workflow:

1. **Trigger:**
   - Start the workflow with an appropriate trigger. For example, you can use a "When an item is created or modified" trigger if you're working with a SharePoint list.

2. **Initialize Variable:**
   - Initialize a Boolean variable, say `isRevisionSent`, and set its initial value to `false`.

3. **Do Until Loop:**
   - Add a "Do Until" loop in your flow.
   - Set the condition of the loop to run until `isRevisionSent` equals `true`.

4. **Approval Step:**
   - Inside the "Do Until" loop, add an approval action where the supervisor approves the request.
   - You can use the "Start an approval" action in Power Automate.
   - Wait for the approval response.

5. **Condition:**
   - After the approval action, add a condition to check if the supervisor approved the request.
   - If the approval is granted, proceed to the finance revision process. If not, you might want to notify the requester or take appropriate actions based on your requirements.

6. **Finance Revision:**
   - Within the "If Yes" branch of the condition (if the approval is granted), perform the necessary finance revision tasks.

7. **Update Variable:**
   - After the finance revision is completed, set the `isRevisionSent` variable to `true` to exit the "Do Until" loop.

8. **Completion Actions (Optional):**
   - Add any actions that need to be performed after the finance revision is completed. For example, you can send a confirmation email, update a status field in your SharePoint list, or log the revision completion in another system.

Remember, the specific actions and conditions might vary based on your exact requirements and the systems you're integrating with. Make sure to configure the actions in your Power Automate flow accordingly.
