Get all liens requests for checks memos // pseu·do·code 

requests = get_all_liens_requests_for_checks_memos()
Filter requests for each view

ready_to_be_processed_requests = []
awaiting_action_requests = []
processed_requests = []

for request in requests:
if request['Processed'] != 'Yes' and request['FormStatus'] == 'Request Approved':
ready_to_be_processed_requests.append(request)
elif request['FinanceStatus'] in ['Pending', 'Revision Needed', 'Accepted'] and request['Processed'] != 'Yes':
awaiting_action_requests.append(request)
elif request['MemoStatus'] == 'Accepted':
processed_requests.append(request)
Render the homepage with the three views

render_homepage(ready_to_be_processed_requests, awaiting_action_requests, processed_requests)

This pseudocode assumes that the following functions are available:

    get_all_liens_requests_for_checks_memos(): Returns a list of all liens requests for checks memos.
    render_homepage(): Renders the homepage with the three views.

The render_homepage() function would need to be implemented to generate the HTML for the three views, and to populate the views with the filtered requests.
